 Modelling the COVID-19 virus evolution using incremental machine learning methods


Being able to accurately predict the evolution of the COVID-19virus is a key aspect to mitigate its effects on public health. Thereare many well-known methods in the literature that have beenapplied for modelling time-series predictions. However, there is areally convenient approach called Incremental methods that have not been applied yet to COVID-19 forecasting.
